## 💫 About Me

I am an **Applied AI Engineer** with strong hands-on experience in **Machine Learning**, **Computer Vision**, **Natural Language Processing**, and **MLOps**. I focus on transforming AI research into **production-ready systems** that solve real-world problems.

I have worked on **medical imaging**, **agriculture AI**, and **security-focused NLP systems**, building complete pipelines from data preprocessing and model training to deployment and monitoring. I enjoy working at the intersection of **model development and software engineering**, ensuring AI solutions are reliable, scalable, and reproducible.

- 🔭 **Currently working on:** End-to-end ML pipelines, Computer Vision systems, and LLM-based applications  
- 🌱 **Currently learning:** Advanced MLOps workflows, Vector Databases, LangChain & LangGraph  
- 👯 **Open to collaborate on:** Medical Imaging, Agriculture AI, NLP systems, and applied ML projects  
- 💬 **Ask me about:** ML project structuring, CNNs, Transformers, Docker, Airflow, and cloud deployment  
- ⚡ **Mindset:** I believe strong AI systems are built with clean code, solid pipelines, and practical evaluation — not just high accuracy numbers
